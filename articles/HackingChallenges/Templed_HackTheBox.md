# Templed

So let's unzip and find an image, some cryptic code.  
So after typing "templar code", Wikipedia showed me the Cypher of the Monks which is exactly the same  
There is only one difference, ours is like a superposition of multiple original symbols.  

72 84 66 123 77 48 78 107 115 95 107 78 51 119 33 125

We got this, let's just transform it into HEX: 
`printf "%x " 72 84 66 123 77 48 78 107 115 95 107 78 51 119 33 125`

And boom we got  
> 48 54 42 7b 4d 30 4e 6b 73 5f 6b 4e 33 77 21 7d

And then let's just transform it into ascii and it was the right guess !!!
