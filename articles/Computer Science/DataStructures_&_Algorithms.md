# Why you should learn DS&Algorithms

There are sooo many DS & Algorithms you can't know all of them and most of them you'll probably not understand them completely, but having the idea will help you a lot.
Just knowing that all those techniques with their own specific usage will help you in your daily coding as you'll use more adapted techniques that matches your real need.

We don't need to always use arrays or List<> (For HighLvl languages), they aren't always what you really need and so isn't it better to use something who perfectly match, this is optimisation: don't take too much , take what you need.
Most of the time it'll lead to clearer projects, waaay easier to understand and the complexity will match your needs.

But what is complexity ? Alright let's have a sub-topic

## Algorithm Complexity

Let's make it really simple, basically for every action that you do one your computer you use time and space isn't it ?
Okay sweet, but have you ever care about it ? Have you ever think about 'is it greedy or not' ?
Complexity is the calculation of this time you'll take to complete an action, how to calculate it ? 
As it is really long and would need a complete article, I'll now give you this article which describe perfectly how it works

[Introduction to Time Complexity of An Algorithm - careerbaba.in](https://web.archive.org/web/20140929181245/http://careerbaba.in/2014/01/introduction-to-time-complexity-of-an-algorithm/)

This complexity helps us determine if an algorithm is worth it or not, his efficiency. 
We can then use this complexity + our logic to determine which Algorithms or Data Structure you should use in multiple situation

# How am I supposed to learn that ?

There are maaaany ways, but the easiest one for me is: practicing.
For example, grab a DS description on Wikipedia and try to implement it, once it's done look at some code on google and understand why you should have done one thing or another.

Another way is to browse some repos on Github such as this one:

[romain325/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms](https://github.com/romain325/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms)

Yeah this is AutoPromotion lol :)) (Come add your knowledge and correct me if I'm wrong :)))

But there are a lot of other resources that can help you like this account: 

[The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms)

I personnaly love this account sooo much !! So go have a look and learn from it !

# In Conclusion

DataStructures & Algorithmics doesn't look really attracting to many beginner devs (I'm a student and a beginner and I see all my mate hating this subject :// ) but it is really helpful and really interesting once you head in without taking care of your prejudice on the subject ! 

One day or another you'll need DS & Algo in your life so go ahead now and learn some, even the most basic one like Queue, Stack, What is a FIFO, a FILO, how to use a Binary Tree, a graph and how to implement them, once you're in you'll find a lot of interest for it !
