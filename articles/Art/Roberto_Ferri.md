# ROBERTO FERRI

Have you ever heard of Roberto Ferri ?  
A beautiful baroque/romantic inspiration, a outbreathing sense of precision, meaningful and full of sensation paintings.  
Let's check out some of his pieces then !

> *'Slave to the shadow'*, oil on canvas, Roberto Ferri

Born in Taranto,Italy in 1978, he is known worldwide and graduated with honors by the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome.

His work has been presented all over the world in many many exposition.  

The central point of his art is the expression of bodies, he mastered the ability to express feelings and messages through these paintings.  

He is known for his technical abilities with which he creates expressive, technical and tormented paintings. Most of his art reflects beauty, grace but at the same time torment, pain and chaos.  
His ability to perfectly mix surrealism, baroque and many other classic styles creates a feeling of unchained classicism.  

## Angels

The angels is a recurrent theme is M.Ferri painting and especially fallen angel who've totally lost hope and look directly to the ground, as if they are asking themself if they could go even lower.  
Representation such as *Fallen Angel* or *Lucifer* totally express this feeling, where everything seems lost and all that matters is the thoughts of those characters which are nearly understandable and readable through the painting.

But sometimes the pain just explode through the painting and let us feel how deep his form of art his, for example with the pieces *The Marriage of Heaven and Hellway*

![The Marriage of Heaven and Hellway](https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00169/images/roberto-ferri/heaven-and-hellway.JPG!Large.JPG)
> *'The Marriage of Heaven and Hellway'*, Roberto Ferri

Through this painting the concept of Heaven and Hell are mixing together to create a form mixed between an hurted angel wing, attached to a human form slowly transforming (only one wing, the transformation of his head and the orientation of his body, going into the deep).  
We can feel despair and how hurted this representation is.

This painting comes as an opposition of *'Redemption'* which express an hopeful message, but at the same time Redemption makes us question about what is "hopfulness".  

![Redemption](https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00169/images/roberto-ferri/dark-winged-angels.jpg!Large.jpg)
> *'Redemption'*, Roberto Ferri

As we can observe a human form is getting lifted by angels with a divine light making him comes out of the painting.  
But the color of the angel's wings makes us question about what kind of redemption this is. All "white winged" angel reprensent a despair and suffering when the "black winged" angel are active, not suffering from their world. If we take *'Lucifer'* which as been cited earlier, we can see that he doesn't seems to suffer from his state of fallen angel, he accepts and just thinking, maybe fighting his own thoughts. The only thing that is restraining him from living normally is his boulder.  
He doesn't express regrets as he don't have to follow dictats anymore.  
And the expression of this redemption by Fallen Angel looks like an opening to a new world, maybe not the one we expect but the one who accept him.  
The human character seems to come out from a Water well, like a suicid, there is a dissonance between the vision of suicide in western cultur and the title "Redemption".  

**Those paintings can have a lot of understanding and those are mine, do your own reflection and don't follow mine as they will certainly not fit yours.**  

## Humans and their relation with death

Death is a pretty recurrent subject in Roberto Ferri pieces and some of them seems linked, telling us a story who just need to be understanded.  
For example I see a correlation between multiples pieces that we'll explore.  

![Prigione di Lacrime](https://i1.wp.com/www.carteggiletterari.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-57.jpeg?fit=884%2C633&ssl=1)
> *'Prigione di lacrime'*, Roberto Ferri

Talking about the technical aspect first, the representation of the body, his textures and everything is just breathtaking and needs to be acclaimed!  
But this painting is also in link with our last subject [[Angels]] as we can discern black wings in the top-right corner. The chain around can represent the link between the angel and this woman, and the love between them which is certainly the reason of his state of fallen angel, the suffering from the lost of a loved one.  
This suffering is also reflected by the impact of his hand on her body, a strong and powerful grab, a way to keep her close as she slowly disappear.  
A similar piece of art named *'Il Rito'* is the exact opposite of this painting with the same characters.

> *'Il Rito'*, Roberto Ferri

The fallen angel got rid of his wings (his state of angel) to save her
![Remove](https://fiercefragile.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/1.jpg)

And now that he gave her his life, he is know the one on the verge of the end, his back is ripped and his skin color become paler in the opposite of his loved one who's back to life, supporting him through this with the same expression on the hand, a strong and powerful grab of the loved one as a way to keep him alive.  

And we can even see the dispear of this lose with another painting, leading the protagonist to slowly become crazy as they don't want to be far the one from the other.

Even with the state of a skeleton totally empty of everything, she stills look at him with eyes full of love and desperetly try to keep him close to her.  
This painting is blood free except on one point, maybe used as an accentuation.  
We can see her hand leading to his heart, literally in his ribcage as a last tentative to feel him close, feel again this feeling of being close and connected to sby when your heart are beating together.

**Second Reminder, I'm not a critic and this is how I feel those paintings at the time and I would certianly see them differently depending of my state of mind.**  

To conclude, Roberto Ferri is a technical expert, mixing old style with the modernity of the daring to express deep and unusual theme through them.

I totally love his art and will certainly do a second article.
